# StickyNotesApp

This is a simple command line app which you can use to store your thoughts on virtual sticky notes.

I am using this project to get used to building something real instead of just doing tutorials and reading books. The whole application is written in Java and works on the command line, but I am thinking about making a graphical version later.
